# Section 5: Virtual Agent Designer with LLM

**Estimated time: 45 minutes**

## Overview

In this section, we'll create an intelligent Virtual Agent topic using the external LLM capabilities configured in the previous section. This exercise demonstrates how to design custom conversational flows using ServiceNow's Virtual Agent Designer with OpenAI integration.

### What We'll Build

We will create a Virtual Agent that:
1. **Greets users** and asks how they're feeling
2. **Performs sentiment analysis** on the user's response
3. **Routes the conversation** based on sentiment:
   - **Positive/Neutral:** Provides encouraging response and ends conversation
   - **Negative:** Asks how the agent can help and searches knowledge base
4. **Searches knowledge base** for relevant information
5. **Summarizes findings** and provides helpful responses

### Expected Solution Architecture

The completed solution will implement this conversational flow:
