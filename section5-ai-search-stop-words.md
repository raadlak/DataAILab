# Section 6: Stop Words and AI Search Configuration

**Estimated time: 25 minutes**

## Overview

Stop words are common words that are typically filtered out during text processing and search operations. In ServiceNow AI Search, stop words are stored in Dictionary objects, and each search profile can have one dictionary associated with it.

This section covers:
- Creating custom stop word dictionaries

- **Reducing processing:** Less computational overhead
- **Enhanced ranking:** Better relevance scoring for search results

## Prerequisites

   - No validation errors ‚úì

## Section 6.3: Troubleshooting Dictionary Issues

### Common Issue: Publishing Error

**Problem:** Cannot publish search profile due to unpublished dictionaries

![Publishing Error](screenshots/image58.png)

**Error Message:**
```
"You cannot publish this profile yet, because you have unpublished 
dictionaries linked to this profile. Check the 'State' field of 
your dictionaries."
```

### Root Cause Analysis

**Cause:** Orphaned many-to-many (m2m) records in the table `ais_search_profile_ais_dictionary_m2m` that are:
- Linked to the AI Search Profile
- NOT linked to any AI Dictionary (showing as "empty")

### Resolution Steps

**Step 1: Identify Orphaned Records**

1. Navigate to **System Definition > Tables**
2. Search for table: `ais_search_profile_ais_dictionary_m2m`
3. Identify records with empty dictionary references

**Step 2: Clean Up Orphaned Records**

1. **Backup the records** before deletion (important for rollback)
2. **Delete the orphaned m2m records** that show as "(empty)"

**Step 3: Publish Search Profile**

3. **Publish the AI Search Profile** - the error should now be resolved

![Successful Publication](screenshots/image60.png)

### Prevention Measures

To prevent future orphaned records:
- Always unlink dictionaries properly before deletion
- Use the UI for dictionary management rather than direct table manipulation
- Validate configurations before publishing
- Regular maintenance of search profile associations

## Section 6.5: Testing Stop Words Implementation

### Before Stop Words Implementation

Test search functionality before applying stop words:

![Search Before Stop Words](screenshots/image66.png)

**Test Query:** "Help me with the password reset process"
**Results:** May include many irrelevant matches due to common words

### After Stop Words Implementation

Test the same search with stop words active:

![Search After Stop Words](screenshots/image67.png)

**Same Test Query:** "Help me with the password reset process"
**Results:** More focused, relevant results with noise words filtered

### Validation Metrics

**Search Quality Improvements:**
- **Precision:** Higher percentage of relevant results
- **Recall:** Still capturing all important matches
- **Speed:** Faster search processing
- **User Satisfaction:** More useful search experience

## Section 6.6: Best Practices for Stop Words

### Domain-Specific Considerations

**IT Service Management Stop Words:**
```
ticket, incident, request, issue, problem, case, record, item, entry
```

**HR Service Delivery Stop Words:**
```
employee, staff, person, individual, team, department, group
```

**Customer Service Stop Words:**
```
customer, client, user, caller, contact, person, individual
```

### Balancing Act

**Too Few Stop Words:**
- Results in noisy search results
- Slower processing
- Poor relevance ranking

**Too Many Stop Words:**
- May filter out important terms
- Reduced recall
- Missing relevant content

### Regular Maintenance
